I am a PhD student and [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about_grfp) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. My work in the [Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/) focuses on predicting real-world health behaviors and health outcomes in an effort to advance a precision medicine framework for behavioral health.

As part of my doctoral training, I am pursuing a [Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization) focused on reproducibility, data visualization, functional programming, and machine learning. I have also served as a lab instructor for the graduate-level [Data Analysis Sequence](https://github.com/uopsych) in the Department of Psychology. 

As an aspiring data scientist, my goal is to implement my skills as a researcher in an applied industry setting to develop open-source analytical tools that support health and wellness across the lifespan.
