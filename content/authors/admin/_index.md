I am a PhD student and [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about_grfp) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. My work in the [Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/) focuses on individual differences in health behavior change and predictive modelling of health outcomes in an effort to advance a precision medicine framework for behavioral health.

As part of my doctoral training, I am pursuing a [Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/data-science-specialization-educational-leadership) focused on reproducible data analysis, data visualization, functional programming, and machine learning. In addition, I have served as a [lab instructor](/courses/) for both undergraduate statistics and a graduate-level [Data Analysis Sequence](https://github.com/uopsych) in the Department of Psychology. 

I am also an [RStudio Certified Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/cullen+brendan/) in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) -- please feel free to [reach out](mailto:bcullen@uoregon.edu) if you're interested in having me lead a workshop or training for you. You can see an example of my teaching materials [here](https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/).
