Some time ago I wrote about how we [need more data science training](https://bcullen.rbind.io/post/2020-03-08-data-science-training-needs-in-grad-school/) as grad students in psychology and that one of the best ways for us to get this training is to [learn from each other](https://twitter.com/_bcullen/status/1237414725081653249). This is just one of many reasons why I'm so humbled and excited to have recently become an [RStudio Certified Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/cullen+brendan/) in the tidyverse. 

As a small way of paying it forward, I wanted to offer a reflection on what I think makes this training so unique and worthwhile along with a summary of what's involved and some resources for those who might be interested in knowing more.

# The *what*

The best place the start is to read about the RStudio Instructor Training and Certification Program [here](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#info). The process boils down to three steps.

## (1) Training Course `r fontawesome::fa("chalkboard-teacher")`

The first step is to sign up for the training course, which will likely be held over Zoom and chunked into 3-4 hour segments across 2-3 days. You can access the training materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).

The training course is an interactive introduction to applying evidence-based teaching methods to data science education, such as [learner personas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aOnX-B9XlAzkrlIeZa5db3_X2Dk8cS27k3klvPn1SQI/edit), [concept maps](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k45SqyM-w4DtK7dmedeX7pk_r8B9Aq0FKKCxC04pTRM/edit), and [formative assessment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBxBFpkB4w-C3_l2rWdGMtjxaxDeu8gVP0K0CHJfbdQ/edit) (i.e. short, diagnostic questions or exercises to figure out if learners are forming accurate mental models). The course also covers how to design teaching materials with [reverse instructional design](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBxBFpkB4w-C3_l2rWdGMtjxaxDeu8gVP0K0CHJfbdQ/edit#slide=id.g5501944768_0_197) that takes into account [cognitive load](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t9QTkRfGP9WYQjiXoaVAuceFe3ySVe_wLT7j2MYC8bE/edit#slide=id.g39e398e252_0_14), [multiple learning strategies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bq599QkDdaWXmw-B8JM5jwdl5In9O-NTxLPT2iES0vY/edit#slide=id.g5479673425_0_87), and issues of [inclusivity and student motivation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uYQCbs88aao7Ho4d4mUfYi6hOXhgHWV6noR_-jOaE50/edit) in the classroom.

## (2) Technical Exam `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code")`

The technical exam assesses your profiency in whatever topic for which you are attempting to become a certified instructor. Currently there are options to become a certified instructor in [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), and each has its own accompanying technical exam. I took the tidyverse exam, which, broadly speaking, consists of a series of live coding challenges related to using core tidyverse packages for data cleaning and wrangling, data visualization, string manipulation, functional programming, basic statistical modeling, and creating reproducible documents with R Markdown. As many others have suggested, a great way to prepare for this exam is to work through the exercises [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), particularly for topics that feel rusty to you, and review the community-contributed [solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).

I highly recommend going through these sample exams start to finish to get a sense of what you might need to review:

* [Sample Tidyverse Exam 1](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/#tidyverse-certification-exam) ([solutions](https://marlycormar.github.io/tidyverse_sample_exam/sample_exam_sols/sols.html)) 
* [Sample Tidyverse Exam 2](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/08/more-example-exams/#tidyverse-exam)

## (3) Teaching Exam `r fontawesome::fa("user-graduate")`

The first certification exam assesses pedagogical skills related to teaching data science with R and requires giving a demonstration lesson, creating formative assessments on unseen material (e.g. multiple choice questions and fill-in-the-blank coding exercises), developing concept maps on data science topics, and giving feedback on example educational exercises based on pedagogical theory.


If you'd like to see an example of a demonstration lesson, below are the materials I created for this portion of the teaching exam. I used [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) an example dataset. (why? because penguins `r emo::ji("penguin")` `r emo::ji("penguin")` `r emo::ji("penguin")`). 

> You can find all of this material and the accompanying code on [Github](https://github.com/brendanhcullen/rstudio-instructor-certification). Feel free to share, adapt and re-use for your own teaching.

## Sample lesson: **Column-wise operations with `dplyr`: Old and New**

### `r emo::ji("link")` [Slides](https://columnwise-operations-dplyr.netlify.app/) `r fontawesome::fa("film")`

I made heavy use of [`{xaringan}`](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/), [`{xaringanExtra}`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/), and [`{flair}`](https://kbodwin.github.io/flair/index.html) along with [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/)'s unbeatable [artwork](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations). For an excellent `{xaringan}` tutorial, I recommend you check out [these slides](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html#1), from the R Markdown whisperer herself, [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://columnwise-operations-dplyr.netlify.app/"
)
```

### Concept Map `r fontawesome::fa("sitemap")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("columnwise_concept_map.png")
```

For other re-useable data science concept maps, see [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ForBjP0pVhljBLuqOyYfyHw_1rrwJzpWW1ZHzCqAJpU/edit#slide=id.p).

### Learner Persona `r fontawesome::fa("user")`

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("learner_persona.png")
```

For a list of other example learner personas, see [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/learner-personas/).

### `r emo::ji("link")` [Formative Assessment](https://brendancullen.shinyapps.io/columnwise_operations_formative_assessment/) `r fontawesome::fa("user-edit")`

I created these exercises using the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package, which I highly recommend you check out. It's quite powerful and versatile. 

Here's a quick look.

# The *why*

Ok, that might seem like quite a bit of time and work. Why go to the trouble of doing this traning? 

In a word, [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/).

Ok, there are many reasons, but in all seriousness 

Greg's most important [advice for teaching](https://third-bit.com/10rules/#teaching), in my opinion: 

> "Be kind: all else is details."

# Get in touch

That's all for now. Please feel free to [reach out](https://twitter.com/_bcullen) any time if you are thinking of participating in the training yourself and want to hear more from someone who's gone through it recently. I would be glad to chat!
