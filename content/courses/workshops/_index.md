I organized and taught a 3-day introductory R Bootcamp for my fellow ducks in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon in September 2020. This bootcamp gives a gentle introduction to R and RStudio, transforming and visualizing data with the tidyverse, and the basics of R Markdown. It assumes no prior experience with R or any other programming language and is designed to get learners up and running with the most widely useful tools for reproducible data analysis in R while emphasizing best practices for writing code and organizing project-oriented workflows.

## Column-wise operations with dplyr: Old and New

While preparing to become an RStudio Certified Instructor, I put together a lesson on column-wise operations using the dplyr package -- in other words, how to apply data transformations to multiple columns of data simultaneously. This was a fun opportunity to not only learn about this topic in much greater depth but also to implement modern teaching methods I had recently learned, including [concept maps](https://github.com/brendanhcullen/rstudio-instructor-certification#concept-map), [learner personas](https://github.com/brendanhcullen/rstudio-instructor-certification/blob/master/README.md#learner-persona), and [formative assessment](https://brendancullen.shinyapps.io/columnwise_operations_formative_assessment), among others. You can find the source code and accompanying materials for this lesson on [Github](https://github.com/brendanhcullen/rstudio-instructor-certification).

## Introduction to Git and Github

<i class="fab fa-github"></i> [brendanhcullen/git-tutorial](https://github.com/brendanhcullen/git-tutorial)

I taught an introductory workshop for first-year psychology PhD and Master’s students on basics of using Git and Github for version control in February 2020. I also taught a more advanced version of this workshop for University of Oregon’s Data Science Club in 2019, including a discussion of merge conflicts, branching, pull requests, and best practices for collaborative Github projects. I [regularly use Github](https://github.com/brendanhcullen) to more easily track and share my work, and I have enjoyed the opportunity to help my fellow grad students get started with learning the "why" and "how" of using version control. Credit for the vast majority of the original workshop materials goes to [Dani Cosme](https://dcosme.github.io/).
