#### **Below are links to the labs that I created and taught in Fall 2019.** 

[R basics and descriptives](https://brendanhcullen.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-2.html)

* The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to some simple tools that will allow you to calculate and visualize descriptive statistics in R. This will not be a deep dive into the theoretical meaning behind descriptives, but rather a guide to some practical steps toward getting the most basic summary information out of a given dataset. Along the way, we will implement some basic R skills such as creating variables, working with data frames, installing packages, and learning how to use new functions.

[Matrix Algebra in R](https://brendanhcullen.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-3.html) 

* The purpose of this lab is to learn how to create matrices in R and how to perform basic mathematical functions on matrices using R functions. We will also focus during the minihacks on applying what you learned in lecture to create linear combinations of data, including calculating some basic descriptive statistics

[Data Transformation with dplyr](https://brendanhcullen.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-5.html)

* The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the tidyverse as a framework for working with data structures in R. We will mostly focus on data wrangling (particularly data transformation), including how to extract specific observations and variables, how to generate new variables and how to summarize data.

[Pre-registration](https://brendanhcullen.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-7.html) 

* The purpose of this lab is to walk through how to create a pre-registration on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). Rather than serve as a step-by-step tutorial, this page will mostly contain links to other resources on pre-registration and open science that you can use when drafting your own preregistrations, along with a few questions/prompts to guide our discussion.

[Paired samples t-tests](https://brendanhcullen.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-9.html)

* This lab will guide you through the process of conducting a paired samples t-test. As we did with [one-sample and independent samples t-tests](https://brendanhcullen.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-8.html), we will first cover how to a conduct a paired samples t-test by hand. Then we will use functions from the {stats} and {lsr} packages to conduct the analysis. We will also discuss how to interpret the results and plot the data using {ggpubr}.
