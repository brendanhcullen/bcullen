As part of my graduate training at the University of Oregon, I completed a Data Science Specialization in Educational Leadership, taught by [Daniel Anderson](https://www.datalorax.com/).

Here are a few samples of the projects I worked on:

### Flexdashboard

A flexdashboard that visualizes data from the Big Cities Health Inventory:
