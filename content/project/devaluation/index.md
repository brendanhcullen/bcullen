This project is a large-scale randomized-control trial that investigates the efficacy and mechanisms of a healthy eating invention. Specifically, the RCT compares a cognitive reappraisal training, in which participants change the way they think about unhealthy food, to a behavioral response training, in which participants modify their physical motor responses to food stimuli to train neural inhibitory control circuits. Currently, I am working on developing a precision medicine analysis pipeline around a series of additional measures that have been added to this parent R01 as part of the National Center for Biotechnology Informationâ€™s [ADOPT Project](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/adopt) (Accumulating Data to Optimally Predict Obesity Treatment). The ADOPT project aims to solve the precision medicine problem for obesity treatment by identifying core measures assessing a range of behavioral, biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors that contribute to obesity. My role in this project is to develop the analytical infrastructure to create and validate composites of low-cost, easily administered individual difference measures that moderate response to the healthy eating interventions in terms of both magnitude and timing.
